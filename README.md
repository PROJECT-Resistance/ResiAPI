# ResiAPI

This is a username API for [Resi](https://lordvertice.hopto.org/LordVertice/resistance-bot), our Discord bot. Resi (and possibly other projects) can access our database to read/write information about any of our members, in order to keep track of changing usernames and to connect a member's Discord username with their Minecraft UUID.

## Usage

You can access the API under the endpoints `/users` or `/users/:id` with the HTTP methods `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`. Use `GET` on `/users` to find out the format.

## Contributing
Please help, I have no idea what  I'm even doing.
